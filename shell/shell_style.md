## Long-args over Short-args

Not everyone remembers what a one-letter argument actually means
 * When scripting you don't need the fast-typing benefits of the shell
 * "The shell's primary usage is interactive. The vast majority of shell commands are executed once and never need to be read again. This means that terseness is more important than a readable syntax."
